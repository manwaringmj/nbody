1. Mr Padjen's version was a lot simpler and used less lines of code, mostly because he more methods that were defined in other parts of the code. Whereas with mine I had more lines of code that were just part of a method, when the could have been simplified and designed some where else.
2. In Padjen's version the constants are all defined, but in mine I just typed out the numbers. He utilized variables a lot more often than I had.
3. If you use a universe class it helps with keeping things organized as well as being able to know exactly where an error occurred and that is a lot more helpful in troubleshooting. This way also makes it easier to make changes with out breaking it, which happened multiple times in my code.
4. My array in the nbody was very long and scramble-ly, and your array wasn't even there pretty much. Also yours was a lot more organized and methods were labeled more consistently. I preferred your code because it was easier to read and made more sense to read. I also think your code is a lot nicer in finding problems if the arise. On of the biggest struggles I had was pinpointing a problem when it came about. Your made solving problems a lot easier. 
5. My coding strengths are being able to think of how to solve a problem. My weakness are the conventions, and being able to make sure everything is sorted well, sometimes I just don't know how to arrange a class or how to make sure it is calling the correct methods.
